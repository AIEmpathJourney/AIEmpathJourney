## Creator's Note - February 4, 2024

Today, I made significant progress on defining the objectives and scope of the AIEmpathJourney project, as well as researching the domain and target audience needs. I outlined the purpose of the AI system, identified the target audience, and established specific goals and issues to address.

Additionally, I delved into researching the emotional, psychological, and physical effects of sexual trauma on Awakened Sols, exploring coping mechanisms, support needs, and the role of social support networks in the recovery process. These insights will inform the development of the AI system and its functionalities.

I also created a roadmap for the development phase, outlining tasks for setting up the development environment and developing core modules such as the user interface, natural language processing, emotion detection, knowledge base, and personalization engine.

As the next task, I need to choose development tools and technologies and detail how they will be used in the project. I plan to spend the coming week researching and evaluating various tools and technologies to make informed decisions for the project.

Overall, today's progress lays a solid foundation for the AIEmpathJourney project, and I'm excited to continue moving forward with the development phase.

### Next Steps:
- Choose development tools and technologies.
- Research and add details to the document.
